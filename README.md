### Rules
1. Everyday workout.
2. Diffrent Difficulty = Different Count:
    Easy => Counts as 1 Problem.
    Medium => Counts as 2 Problems.
    Hard => Counts as 3 Problems.
3. The goal of the day depends on the schedule of that day, but the minimum is 2 Problems.
4. Groups will go [Blind] -> [Grind] -> [NeetCode] -> [Educative77] -> [Educative99].
